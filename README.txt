Project: Planner that is meant to help keep students organized by keeping track of their academic classes and the todo items within each class. 

What user stories were completed this iteration?
This iteration, we created the basic frameworks of the academic Class and Todo java classes, with some of the parameters in each. 

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
Next iteration, we plan to create a Planner class which will keep track of a student's Classes and Todo items. 

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
Currently, we are unable to get user input from the command line. We will resolve this issue for iteration 2. This means that our Planner and plannerTest classes do not work properly right now. 

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
