Project: Planner that is meant to help keep students organized by keeping track of their academic classes and the todo items within each class. 

What user stories were completed this iteration?
This iteration, we created the basic frameworks of the Class, Todo, and Planner java classes, with some very basic variables in each class. 
In the second iteration, the user is able to add a class and a todo to the planner. The user is also able to view the current list of todos and classes.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
Next iteration, we plan to further build out the Planner class, which will keep track of a student's Classes and Todo items. We will also add functionality in terms of seeing which todo's are completed and which are yet to be completed. 
For the third iteration, we intend to build out the Todo items so that the user is able to delete and check off a todo. Another user story we intend to implement next iteration is to assign each todo a priority level and print the todos in their respective classes with the todos listed in order of highest to lowest priority. 

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
Currently, everything we implemented works. However, it is an extremely simple program that prompts the user to enter a class name, and then repeats the class name back in the terminal. This is as far as we have gotten so far but plan on building this out more extensively for iteration 2. 

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
In the command line, cd into src, and then run:

javac Planner.java
java Planner

You will be promted to enter a class name, and the program should repeat it back to you. We will build this out much more in future iterations. 
For this second iteration, you will be prompted to enter a list of commands to add classes, todos and view the output.
