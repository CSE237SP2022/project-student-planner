Project: Planner that is meant to help keep students organized by keeping track of their academic classes and the todo items within each class. 

What user stories were completed this iteration?
This iteration, we created the basic frameworks of the academic Class and Todo java classes, with some of the parameters in each. 

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
Next iteration, we plan to create a Planner class which will keep track of a student's Classes and Todo items. 

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
Currently, everything we implemented works. However, it is an extremely simple program that prompts the user to enter a class name, and then repeats the class name back in the terminal. This is as far as we have gotten so far but plan on building this out more extensively for iteration 2. 

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
In the command line, cd into src, and then run:

javac Planner.java
java Planner

You will be promted to enter a class name, and the program should repeat it back to you. We will build this out much more in future iterations.
